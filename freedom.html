      <h2>Why Freedom Matters</h2>
      <p>The Internet was once a place where knowledge flowed freely, innovation thrived, and collaboration was celebrated. Today, this freedom is threatened by restrictive policies, censorship, and monopolistic control by corporations. A free Internet empowers individuals to explore ideas, share knowledge, and express themselves without fear of surveillance or suppression.</p>
      <p>Freedom is not just about access—it's about opportunity, fairness, and the ability to shape one's digital journey without undue influence. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that the web remains a space for growth and diversity.</p>

      <h2>The Current Challenges</h2>
      <p>Several key issues challenge the freedom of the Internet:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Mass Surveillance:</strong> Governments and corporations collect personal data at unprecedented scales, compromising privacy and freedom of expression.</li>
        <li><strong>Censorship:</strong> Many regions impose strict controls on what content can be accessed or shared, stifling dissent and limiting access to information.</li>
        <li><strong>Monopolization:</strong> A handful of tech giants control vast swathes of the Internet, dictating how we interact with technology and each other.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These challenges highlight the importance of reclaiming the Internet as a space for everyone, not just the powerful few.</p>
